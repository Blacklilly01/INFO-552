My name is Najla Rashad, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree at Drexel University. Through my coursework and field experiences, I am building a strong foundation in librarianship and information science. I also serve as a Library Trainee at the Free Library of Philadelphia, where I gain hands-on experience in public service, community engagement, and daily library operations. I am deeply committed to equitable access to information, digital archiving, and the evolving role of libraries as inclusive, community-centered spaces. My academic and professional journey has been shaped by meaningful projects, specialized training, and real-world practice that align with these core values.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    Explore examples of my projects that include digitization efforts, metadata creation, website development for community history, and digital storytelling initiatives. These projects reflect my interest in preserving cultural memory, improving access to archival materials, and using technology to serve diverse communities.
  </p>
  <p>Course: Resources for Young Adults</p>
    <p>Created a Drupal-based website featuring book reviews and podcasts focused on teen literature. The site includes curated content across a variety of genres such as classic teen fiction, non-fiction, biography, graphic novels, teen TV show adaptations, and LGBTQ+ literature. The project emphasized content organization, audience engagement, and digital presentation tailored for young adult readers.</p>

<p>Community Archiving Event</p>
<p>As part of a collaborative effort with fellow librarians, I co-led a community archiving initiative at our local neighborhood library, titled "Germantown Community Archiving: Let's Make Histories." Designed to encourage storytelling and the preservation of personal and community histories, the event brought together historical organizations from Germantown, Philadelphia, who shared artifacts and curated displays. Community members were invited to digitize personal documents and explore archival microfilm for research. The initiative was featured in Drexel University’s College of Computing & Informatics (CCI) publication and stands as a highlight in my commitment to accessible, community-driven historical preservation.</p>
