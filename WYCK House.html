        <h2>WYCK House</h2>
        <p>The WYCK House, located on Germantown Avenue in Northwest Philadelphia, dates back to the late 1600s and was originally built by Swiss German immigrant Hans Milan. Over the centuries, the residence has undergone several renovations and expansions, yet it still retains its historic character. The estate includes a vibrant garden and working farm, both of which are open to the public.</p>
        <p>Throughout its history, the WYCK House has been home to several prominent families, most notably the Wistars and Haineses. For nine successive generations, it was occupied by Quaker families. In recognition of its historical significance, the house was designated a historic site in 1971 and later named a National Historic Landmark in 1991.</p>
        <p>The WYCK House is deeply connected to Germantown’s rich heritage. It houses a collection of personal narratives, including audio recordings and transcribed interviews conducted by oral historian Julie Rainbow. These oral histories, preserved by the WYCK House organization, provide firsthand insights into the lives of past residents.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the house can explore exhibits showcasing a variety of historical artifacts, curated in collaboration with the Lenfest Center at Drexel University. What makes the WYCK House truly unique is its active engagement with the community. Locals are invited to share their own oral histories, which are then transcribed and archived—bridging generations and preserving stories that might otherwise be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Admission to the gardens, farm, and historical exhibits, including the oral history collection—is free and open to the public.</p>
