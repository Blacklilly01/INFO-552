     Did you know about 35-50% of all food produced is wasted? That's just sad. But did you 
     know much of what you toss into your kitchen's compost bin can be transformed into 
     something scrumptiously edible (provided it's not already looking like a science
     experiment)? In an attempt to curb my own family's wastefulness I turned to authors
     Giovanna Torrico and Amelia Wasiliev for some zeor waste culinary inpiration.

       <h2>  Zero Waste Cookbook </h2>   

    <p> 
        In their new book The Zero Waste Cookbook: 100 Recipes for Cooking Without
         Waste </p>em>,
           <a  href=" https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Waste-Cookbook-Recipes-
           Cooking/dp/178488247X"> </a>,
         they cover deliciously clever ways to significantly reduce what you'd normally toss.
        </p> 
    <p> 
        Acording to Torrico and Wasiliev, all it takes is a few simple tips to change our 
        thinking - from how and when we buy our food to menu planning and storage - to get us on 
        the way to a zero - waste kitchen. They give straightforward tips on making the most of the 
        food we have: source locally, buy imperfect produce, menu plan, store food smartly, utilize 
        your freezer, preserve, save leftovers, and check your pantry before you go shopping.
    </p> 
    <p> 
        Chapters are broken down by Vegetables, Fruit, Dairy & Eggs, Meat & Seafood, Bread & 
        Pulses (Legumes), and Leftovers. As the authors put it: if you buy good-quality local
        organic, there's no need to peel or chop off the ends. Just incorporate it into your dishes.
        When making tomato sause keep the normally discarded skins, dehydrate them in the oven, 
        and crush them up to make a tasty concentrated powder. It's great mixed with salt
        and to add a punch of a tomatoey flavor to marinades, dips, or dusted over homemade
        potato chips (which, by the way, you can make out of the skins).
    </p> 
    <p>
         The stems of various herbs can easily be used to flavor sparkling water or to infuse oils,
         which are lovely to drizzle over just about anything. The cores of lettuces and cruciferous 
         veggies are delicious when grilled (then drizzle of that infused oil over it along with a grating
         of Parmesan cheese), and stems and ends of or kale, chard, garlic, cucumbers, carrots, and more 
         can easily be transformed into pickles. One of my favorite waste-savers is their Bare Corn-on-Cob 
         Stock where a lovely golden stock is made from corn cobs. Imagine using this wonderful stock   
         use as a souop base or to flavor risottos and stews. Delish! That's just the beginning of their
         ingenious recipes - all made from "scraps." Are your ready to go from waste to wow? Try their 
         flavorful Mixed Herb Stem Salsa Verde recipe below and you, too, will vow to never toss a stem 
         in the compost again

    <h2> Mixed Herb Stem Salsa Verde</h2> 
    <p>
        "Salsa Verde is great served with meat, fish or roasted vegetables. You can also serve it on 
        crostini or use it as a sandwich spread." - Torrico  and Wasilliev
    </p> <br>
    <p> 
       
    Makes 125 ml (4 fl oz/ 1/2 cups) Prep: 15 mins, Rest: 2 Hrs <br>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 30 g (1 oz) stale bread </li>
        <li> 100 g (3 1/2 oz) mixed soft fresh herb stems, such as flat-leaf parsley, basil, and mint</li>
        <li> 1 garlic clove</li>
        <li> 1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li> 2 anchovies </li>
        <li> 40 ml (1 3/4 fl oz/2 1/2 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to cover</li>
        <li> sea salt and black pepper </li>

        </ul> <br>

    <h4> Method </h4> 

    <p>
         Soak the bread in some warm water in a bowl. Meanwhile, wash the herb stems and put them 
         in a food processor or blender along with the garlic, vinegar, anchovies, and oil. Pulse a 
         few times to lightly blend. Squeeze the liquid from the bread and add it to the food processor.
         Blitz to make a creamy but not too thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover with 
         oil and rest in the fridge for 2 hours. This will keep for up to a week in the fridge
