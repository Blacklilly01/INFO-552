    <h2>About: In Her Own Words</h2>
    <p>I began walking the path to an
unexpected STEM career in
September of 2017 when I started
working as a seasonal library assistant
at the Free Library of Philadelphia (FLP).
In my new role, senior librarian encouraged me. Their
affirming words served as the catalyst I
needed, revealing potential within me
that I had not yet recognized. I chose to attend
Drexel University to work on my MS in
Library and Information Science.</p>
<p>Receiving admission to Drexel
University marked a significant
milestone in my journey. During my
first quarter, on a Zoom call, I informed
one of my professors about my efforts
to help plan a new program called
Community Archiving: Let’s Make
Histories. My professor
shared this information with Drexel
alumni and faculty members who
specialize in archiving, and they invited
me to interview with the College of
Computing and Informatics (CCI) team.
The interview led to a feature article
about program, which I created with a team of librarians, and the article appeared
in the CCI online publication.
Having our program acknowledged
by the institution has been one of my
proudest achievements.</p>

<p>Numerous other opportunities
have facilitated the fulfillment
of my academic aspirations and
have contributed to my career
development. In 2021, I received a
Paradigm Scholarship for Working
Women from Philadelphia's Chamber
of Commerce. Another boost to my
STEM career came with a scholarship
from the Pennsylvania Black Librarians’
Caucus, which allowed me to attend
the Pennsylvania Library Association
conference in 2024 in Harrisburg</p>

<p>I also had the good fortune of
attending the American Librarian
Association (ALA) conference in
San Diego in June 2024, and this
past January, I traveled to Phoenix
to participate in the ALA LibLearnX
2025 conference. These kinds of
experiences enable me to connect
with librarians nationwide and to hear
keynote speakers and authors discuss
the profound impact of libraries on
their lives. I have gained a deeper understanding of the
importance of librarianship and of
librarians’ advocacy for literacy. I feel
immensely proud and inspired as I work
toward a career of such significance</p>

<p>am proud to say that I am the first
college graduate in my family. As a
trailblazer, I am carving a new path
in my own right and establishing
a precedent for my children and
grandchildren to follow, which, I must,
say feels amazing.</p>
