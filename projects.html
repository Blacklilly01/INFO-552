    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the projects from courses I have completed:</p>
    <p>Course: Resources for Young Adults</p>
    <p>Created a Drupal-based website featuring book reviews and podcasts focused on teen literature. The site includes curated content across a variety of genres such as classic teen fiction, non-fiction, biography, graphic novels, teen TV show adaptations, and LGBTQ+ literature. The project emphasized content organization, audience engagement, and digital presentation tailored for young adult readers.</p>

<p>Community Archiving Event</p>
<p>As part of a collaborative effort with fellow librarians, I co-led a community archiving initiative at our local neighborhood library, titled "Germantown Community Archiving: Let's Make Histories." Designed to encourage storytelling and the preservation of personal and community histories, the event brought together historical organizations from Germantown, Philadelphia, who shared artifacts and curated displays. Community members were invited to digitize personal documents and explore archival microfilm for research. The initiative was featured in Drexel Universityâ€™s College of Computing & Informatics (CCI) publication and stands as a highlight in my commitment to accessible, community-driven historical preservation.</p>

<p>Designed digital content within a user-friendly system that allows for easy navigation and efficient management, as part of a digital library project.</p>

<p>Foundations Data & Information</p>
<p>This course focused on understanding data, information, and digital content. It also covered strategies for managing information within back-end systems to support front-end interfaces, while examining the societal and economic impacts of data. Additionally, the course explored the structuring and classification of information, including the influence of artificial intelligence. As part of the coursework, I conducted a systems comparison between two companies, analyzing their data collection and utilization processes.
